# File Parser and Converter

This program was made to parse a money order csv into a prn file to be used in another program.
Some items had to be hardcoded (such as the paths) because its purpose was to just sit on the desktop as an exe for the user to run.
The csv would be pulled in, converted, and a prn file would be generated where it needs to be for the user to automatically run the next program.

The formatting had to be PRECISE in order for the next program to read it in properly.
